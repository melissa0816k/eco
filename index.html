<p> President Xi Jinping advanced the building of an ecological civilization, taking a step forward in the construction of “a beautiful China”.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In mid October, factories have been shut down to ensure blue skies for one week-long 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (NCCPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. </p>
 <br>
    <p>The Chinese leader emphasised “speeding up reform of the system for developing an ecological civilization, and building a beautiful China” in this five-yearly congress.</p>
    <br>
    <p>He said, "any harm we inflict on nature will eventually return to haunt us.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>“The modernization is one characterized by harmonious coexistence between man and nature,” he added. </p>
    <br>
    <p>President Xi announced that the Chinese government is set to foster green development, promote ecological progress, intensify protection of the ecosystem and the environment and facilitate reform of environmental monitoring system for the next five-year political term. </p>
    <br>
    <p>According to the 2017 Annual Review by International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), employment in China’s clean energy industry has been increasing, especially in solar photovoltaic and wind industry, due to national plans, corporate market strategies and more. The review even stated, “China is a good example.” </p>

   <p>China has long relied on coal-fired power plants that have suffocated the country. But it is now taking the lead in clean energy. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The Chinese National Energy Administration confirmed its plan to invest at least US$360 billion on renewable energy development such as solar and wind this early year, which would also create about 13 million jobs in the renewable energy sector by 2020. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Not only does China strive for the domestic renewable market, but it also focuses on foreign investment. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The latest report from Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) indicated that China increased its foreign investment in renewables by 60 per cent to reach a record US$32 billion in 2016 and is expected to pick up the pace this year. </p>

    <p>Dr. Delang Claudio, an assistant professor of department of geography at Hong Kong Baptist University, who published an array of books about China’s environmental circumstances,  said that China is making positive progress in this sector. </p>
    <br>
    <p>
However, the academics thought that the central government should be taking more serious steps in the hyraid of economic growth and environment whilst governing the states. </p>
    <br>
    <p>“The more economic growth the province has, the happier the central government will be with the officers,” he said, then “the local government might lower the standard so that they could lower the cost of production” to attract different investors. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The veteran educator also said, “the environmental standard can be cheated; for example, when the officers come and check the factory’s pollution problem, somebody will tell the person in charge to turn off the pollution stuffs.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>President Xi’s thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era has been written into the party charter, as a guiding principle for the party. Eco-civilization is one of his focuses. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The core concept of “ecological civilization” was first introduced in 2007 when China has become the top global emitter of CO2. It was then promoted during 17th Party Congress.</p>
    <br>
    <p>More than 2,000 party delegated gathered in Beijing for the congress, on behalf of the country’s 31 provincial regions, the armed forces and other central institutions. </p>
